### A web-based demo for comparing the CTPP data across different states

![p1](../../media/gallery/apps_ctpp.png "p1 :size=200")

### Goal

This submission includes two data explorers developed explicitly for the freshly released data API so-called "Across State" and "Stack State". The two explorers are developed on a cloud platform for small test user groups to demonstrate and evaluate the potential usage of the APIs. 
 The tool "Across State" not only helps modelers leverage the Endpoint of CTPP data and understand the schema and values in the dataset but also can apply a state filter to select a subset of available counties made a cross-comparison in a box plot.
"Stack State" is another presentation of the same dataset, which takes a step further to help the modeler get a more intuitive comparison regarding the estimation share of the column values in each table across the different states.

### Usage

To access the tool, we created five individual accounts for all judges to log into the platform. Please choose the specially named email below as your account name to access the domain: [click here‚¨âüñ±Ô∏è](http://18.188.110.26/matrix) or log in through the dialog below:

### Evaluation

Once successfully log into the  platform, you would able to see the two tools with the CTPP tag- "Across State" and "Stack State" under popular "Popular Apps" with the "home" tab of the "Store" View. Make sure to click on the App and open  it. You would able to see the information of the app and RUN with it.

If you lose navigation when play with the tool, it's much easier to come back here and access the apps by clicking the following links:
